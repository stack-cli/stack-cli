# Stack: Kubernetes + BaaS

Stack is a Kubernetes-first backend platform. It gives you three big wins from day one:

- **One manifest, full backend**: define your app and the backend services you need in a single `StackApp`.
- **Dev equals prod**: the same CRDs and operator workflow run everywhere Kubernetes runs.
- **No glue work**: Stack creates secrets and wires services automatically.

Looking for a deeper dive? Read the [Stack architecture guide](./architecture/) to see how the operator, CRDs, and supporting services interact.
